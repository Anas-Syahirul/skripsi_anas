\textit{
	The Research and Community Service Institute \emph{(Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian kepada Masyarakat/LPPM)} 
	is an institution in 
	every university in Indonesia. This institution is tasked with managing research and community service carried out by lecturers at the University. Carrying out research and community service is part of the Tridharma of Higher Education which must be carried out by every lecturer and academic community. In managing these activities, an information system is needed that can help manage activity data, so that activity data management can be carried out more effectively, efficiently, and integratedly. The methodology used in this research is the \textit{Software Development Life Cycle \emph{(SDLC)}} waterfall method, where this method consists of several sequential stages starting from requirements analysis to system implementation. This information system will be built using MERN \textit{Stack Development} which is composed of MongoDB as \textit{database}, Express as \textit{back-end}, React as \textit{front-end}, and Node.js as \ textit{runtime environment}. The results of this study are a web-based information system for managing research and PkM data with various features that allow LPPM managers and lecturers to make proposals, search again, and upload documents related to research and/or PkM activities. The developed Information System can assist LPPM in managing data on research activities and PKM, so that data management can be carried out in a more effective, efficient and integrated manner.
