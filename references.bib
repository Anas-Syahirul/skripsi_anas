	abstract = {E-books are widely used as an important resource in learning. The most common way to use e-books is to incorporate them while a learning interaction is in progress. However, some learning styles are better supported inversely: e-books take the lead and are used to initiate and bind learning communications to the topics in focus. Unfortunately, existing e-book formats cannot accommodate this need effectively, potentially causing learning interactions to lose grip on the intended discussion framework. Inability to bind a conversation with the materials in the first place can also introduce overhead cost to the readers due to the burden of bringing the materials into the discussion.
	In this work, we add the capability of e-books to serve as an interaction platform. An e-book is considered as a collection of objects indicating topics of learning discussions. Asynchronous conversation is anchored to one or more topic, and defined by a context that specifies participants and communications among them. Communication is modeled after a reactive mechanism by using event-action pairs. The proposed framework also accommodates dynamics within discussions, as well as structured discussions commonly found in many learning environments.},

Ever since 1994 when the Internet became available to the public and especially in 1995 when the World Wide Web put a usable face on the Internet, the Internet has become a platform of choice for a large number of ever-more sophisticated and innovative Web applications. In just one decade, the Web has evolved from being a repository of pages used primarily for accessing static, mostly scientiﬁc, information to a powerful platform for application development and deployment. New Web technologies, languages, and methodologies make it possible to create dynamic applications that represent a new model of cooperation and collaboration among large numbers of users. Web application development has been quick to adopt software engineering techniques of component orientation and standard components. For example, search, syndication, and tagging have become standard components of a new generation of collaborative applications and processes.},

A SWOT analysis on the selected PICs EMIS through the published technical reports and policy documents from government and donors’ between years 2000 and 2021, revealed that EMIS in PICs have not progressed beyond the stages of collecting demographic data and generating basic indicators. Fiji EMIS which has prospect of leading other PICs EMIS could only generate few indicators manually, and the findings indicate that these indicators are not being considered in decision making. To solve these defects, we proposed datadriven microservices architecture developed with MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) stack on 13 NoSQL collections, tested with pseudonymised data from Fiji Ministry of Education (consisting of 98.6\% Learners, 100.2\% Schools and 99.5\% Teachers in post). Our solution renders dynamic visualized production-ready education data and 28 UNESCO standard indicators to guide decision making and this may serve as a model for PICs EMIS.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICISSEC.2015.7370983},
	abstract = {MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL database nowadays. It is an open-source document-oriented database with flexible schema. To increase performances, it can easily scale both vertically and horizontally. For horizontal scaling, MongoDB uses auto-sharding technique to divide data and distribute it over multiple machines. However, in this technique, a DB administrator must choose a shard key for MongoDB to split its collection. Selecting a right key could improve the performance and capability of a database. Contrarily, a wrong key takes down performances and, in some serious case, could lead to a system halt. Therefore, it is important to choose a correct key. MongoDB has a general suggestion on the properties of its ideal shard key. For instance, a good shard key should have high degree randomness for write scaling and should contain high locality for range-query reading. In order to understand the impact of these properties on a shard key, this paper has analyzed and evaluated such suggested properties. We discussed how the variation of a shard key's choices could impact the DB performance and it gives the base to help a MongoDB admin to understand and could select a good shard key for his/her system.},

Hal tersebut menjadikan permasalahan baru karena pada zaman sekarang semua perbedaan tersebut harus tetap bisa menghasilkan sebuah informasi yang saling terhubung. Maka, diperlukan integrasi sistem. Saat ini Web Service (WS) adalah solusi dalam integrasi sistem karena tanpa melihat platform, arsitektur maupun bahasa pemrograman yang digunakan oleh sumber berbeda. Namun, pada WS keamanan yang ada masih dirasa kurang. Penerapan JSON Web Token (JWT) pada WS sangat berpengaruh dalam hal keamanan data. JWT merupakan mekanisme autentikasi pada WS, tetapi penerapan JWT standar dengan algoritme HMAC SHA-256 masih belum optimal, sehingga pada makalah ini dibahas optimasi keamanan JWT dengan algoritme HMAC SHA-512, yang menurut beberapa penelitian algoritme ini akan lebih baik dibandingkan SHA-256 jika dikompilasi pada arsitektur 64-bit. Hasil menunjukkan, penggunaan SHA-512 menghasilkan waktu yang lebih baik 1\% dibandingkan SHA-256. Namun pada segi ukuran token yang dihasilkan, SHA-512 lebih besar 2\% dibandingkan SHA-256.},

	abstract = {Software development life cycle or SDLC for short is a methodology for designing, building, and maintaining information and industrial systems. So far, there exist many SDLC models, one of which is the Waterfall model which comprises five phases to be completed sequentially in order to develop a software solution. However, SDLC of software systems has always encountered problems and limitations that resulted in significant budget overruns, late or suspended deliveries, and dissatisfied clients. The major reason for these deficiencies is that project directors are not wisely assigning the required number of workers and resources on the various activities of the SDLC. Consequently, some SDLC phases with insufficient resources may be delayed; while, others with excess resources may be idled, leading to a bottleneck between the arrival and delivery of projects and to a failure in delivering an operational product on time and within budget. This paper proposes a simulation model for the Waterfall development process using the Simphony.NET simulation tool whose role is to assist project managers in determining how to achieve the maximum productivity with the minimum number of expenses, workers, and hours. It helps maximizing the utilization of development processes by keeping all employees and resources busy all the time to keep pace with the arrival of projects and to decrease waste and idle time. As future work, other SDLC models such as spiral and incremental are to be simulated, giving project executives the choice to use a diversity of software development methodologies.},

In this paper I have tried to describe different SDLC models according to their best use. There are many papers which have written in this regard. I will also use their knowledge or findings in this paper. The main purpose of this paper is to explain some of important SDLC models like Waterfall Model, Iterative Model, Spiral Model, V-Model, Big Bang Model, Agile Model, Rapid Application Development Model and Software Prototype. The main purpose of this paper is to explain advantages and disadvantages of these SDLC models. I will also describe which SDLC model is best fit for which type of software applications.},

	abstract = {Internet is playing a crucial role in each person's lives. If people are having any kind of doubts regarding any issues, they simply search them in internet If people need to go somewhere new, they simply look up the rankings on the internet. In the same way, if there is a need to visit any consulting agency, internet plays a major role in discovering a high-quality consulting firm on Google. In this study, a new we bsite has been created for L\&Tsoftware technologies. The developed website can be used to locate the products and services provided by the consultancy without any physical visit People can also easily find job openings, and they can clear their doubts by using the contact page remotely. The developed website is further advanced by using MERNSTACK, HTML, CSS,andJAVA SCRIPT. The MERNSTACK is used to create multipage web packages. The web packages made with the help of MERNSTACK are more scalable when compared to different internet programs. The best feature here in the website is Latency. This determines the postponement between request and reaction. In the networking domain, if any statistics is requested from few different devices connected to the network, then the time taken for receiving the primary response is referred to as latency. So, the decrease in the latency will fasten the conversation. Hence, maintaining a low latency on the provided community or net is very critical. Here, 42ms time has been consumed with low latency. So, website works very rapid in terms of verbal exchange. Slowing down facts speeds after a client reaches its monthly information restriction is a not unusual practice among net carrier companies and cellular carriers that is referred to as throttling.},

	abstract = {Node.js is one of the better-known frameworks and environments that support server-side JavaScript development. Many frameworks provide a full-featured Web stack, such as Connect and Express. Finally, many libraries available for client-side JavaScript that were written to comply with the CommonJS module system also work with Node. In my work, we leverage node.js platform to construct a 3D theatre display system, and indicate the advantages of node.js. The single threaded, non-blocking I/O of Node.js solved the problem that the I/O system's performance frequently reach its bottleneck. It not only make full use of CPU performance, but also improve the parallel processing capacity which will accelerate the speed of dealing with frequent I/O. Although there still have some difficulties in transforming it to distribution system , the performance of business processing capacity in single thread is notably improved.},
